Save your money and build your own Alexa. Make her do anything, yeah anything.
Alexa Has Only 2 Tasks:
1. Listening
Listening to your command is the most basic functionality of any virtual assistant, like: “Hey Alexa, play music,” “Hey Alexa, what’s the time?”

Alexa has to listen to your command, understand it, and then do some action.

2. Speaking
Once Alexa listens and understands your command, it performs some action based on it. While doing that, it responds to you by speaking otherwise it’ll be jobless.
